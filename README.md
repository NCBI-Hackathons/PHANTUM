## What is TB?
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that usually affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. Most cases of TB are treatable and curable, but because the majority of TB cases occur in developing areas of the world, the majority of people with TB do not have access to proper treatment. 

There are 10 drugs currently [approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm) for treating TB. Of these approved drugs, the first-line anti-TB agents that form the core of treatment regimens are isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. 

Sometimes drug-resistant TB occurs when bacteria become resistant to the drugs used to treat TB. The [WHO](http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/drug-resistant-tb/types/en/) describes 5 resistance types: 
* mono-resistance: resistance to one first-line anti-TB drug
* poly-resistance: resistance to more than one first-line anti-TB drug, other than both isoniazid and rifampicin
* multidrug resistance (MDR): resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampicin
* extensive drug resistance (XDR): resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and at least one of three second-line injectable drugs (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin), in addition to multidrug resistance
* Rifampicin resistance (RR): resistance to rifampicin detected using phenotypic or genotypic methods, with or without resistance to other anti-TB drugs. It includes any resistance to rifampicin, in the form of mono-resistance, poly-resistance, MDR or XDR.

People who are diagnosed with drug-resistant TB are placed on a regimen of second-line drugs that are less effective than and have more severe side effects than first-line drugs. Mismanagement of TB treatment can lead to spread of drug-resistant TB and higher rates of death. 


## How Bad is TB?
TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide [WHO](http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis). Currently, 2 billion people (about a third of the world's population) are infected with TB. The latest statistics from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/default.htm) show an estimate of 10.4 million new cases of TB in 2016. Of these, the [WHO](http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/drug-resistant-tb/en/) reports that 580,000 of these cases are MDR-TB/RR-TB. Only about 20% of new cases of MDR-TB/RR-TB are estimated to be enrolled in treatment [WHO](http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js23098en/). 


## What Are We Doing About TB?
We developed a web tool for rapid diagnosis of TB drug resistance at point-of-care powered by ML-AI technologies. We wanted to take advantage of the data made available by the [TB Portals Program](https://tbportals.niaid.nih.gov/). 

Three of the top 30 high-burden MDR-TB countries (Azerbaijan, Belarus, and the Republic of Moldova) [WHO](http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/) have data available through the TB Portals program. Georgia and Romania also currently have data accessible, and TB Portals staff are currently working to collect data from other TB endemic countries such as India, China, South Africa.
